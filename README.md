## :warning: Why i did this and that

1. **Header**

    Two things can be easly spoted, a search and a button.

    - Search is a standard way to look for something, i like to cooke, and i know overtime, there would be many recipes. So having a way to look for it is a given. Idea came from https://react-icons.github.io/
    - Button for new recipe

2. **Body**

    The List is here, there are also 3 other components, a lightbox to see the recepie, edit and new recipe.

    - List, with all the recipes, thir devided by cards, each one with a button which provides easy functionality
        - edit recipe
        - delete recipe
    - Lightbox 


3. **why single page**
